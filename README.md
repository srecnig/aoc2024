[advent of code '24](https://adventofcode.com/). trying rust again, let's see how far i get.

## running this

install rust, etc. - check out the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) â€“ it'll explain everything nicely. here's some commands to get started. the input files are not checked in, get them from the advent of code [website](https://adventofcode.com/).

- `cargo new dec13`: create a new package (Â»memberÂ«) in the workspace. i'll use this for every single day.
- `cargo test`: run all the tests.
- `cargo run`: first navigate in the right package folder, otherwise `input.txt` won't be found.
